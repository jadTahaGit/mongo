# View Engines:
- Pug
- Express Handelbars
- EJS


# EJS: HTML & JS:

The Power of EJS and view engines is when we start injecting dynamic content variables and logic in to these views.

EJS Tags are like PHP Tags:
<% const name = "mario" >

EJS looks as default in the folder views.







# Add an Object to the render Function:
In the object you can pass any kind of information!
And then add it to the views For example titles!. See the Code!
